## Description

The purpose of this project was to use node.js, inquirer and javascript OOP properties to take in input from a user about their employees, and generate a team profile webpage for them. It first takes in the details of the team manager and stores them in a Manager object (outlined by a manager class extending an employee class), then gives the user the option to either add an engineer or intern, or finish entering their team. If they choose to keep adding, it will store their information in a class reflecting the employee's role. Each employee object, after being created, is subsequently pushed to an array of employees, which upon on the user saying they are finished, is used to generate the web page.
